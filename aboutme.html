            <h3><p>Hello</p></h3>
            <p>  My name is Laura Krajenta. I'm live in southeast Michigan with my husband, two daughters and two cats and a dog. I love to learn new things. I consider myself a visual person; my bachelorâ€™s degree is in fine arts with a concentration in graphic design. I'd say I have an "old soul" as I love anything vintage, museums, history, old architecture, books, and reading. My biggest passion is to travel more, especially with family and friends. My furthest travel was for study abroad in Germany where I observed German history, art, architecture and I was able to visit serveral design studios and museums in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar. My ultimate bucket list is to visit the Netherlands and Alaska.

                <h3><p>My favorite things and insterests</p></h3>
                <p> I love any downtime to catch up on a good read or t.v. show. Reading has always been a passion and I like so many differnt genres depending on my mood. I am absolute animal lover and foodie. I collect cookbooks. I like to try new recipes. I love vacations, nature, bike rides, coffee, festivitals and concerts, crafty things, listening to music.
